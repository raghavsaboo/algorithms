# Random Algorithms are of two types:

- Frequentist (Las Vegas) 
  - near infinite runtime (finite in expectation) with certainty in correct result
  - e.g. rolling a die until you see the number 6 and counting the number of rolls
- Monte Carlo
  - finite runtime but accuracy can only be stated in terms of probability

# Reservoir Sampling

# Uniform Shuffling (Fisher-Yates Shuffle)

# Markov Chains
