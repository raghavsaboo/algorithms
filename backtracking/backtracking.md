# Backtracking

A systematic way to run through all the possible configurations of a search space. These configurations may represent ==permutations== (all possible arrangements of objects) or ==combinations== (all possible collections/subsets).

Other common situations demand enumerating all spanning trees of a graph, all paths between two vertices, or all possible ways to partition vertices into color classes.

## Constructing all subsets

## Constructing all permutations
